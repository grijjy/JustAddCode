      Parameters:
        AText: the text to speak.

      Returns:
        True if the engine can speak the text, or False if the text could not
        be spoken for some reason.

      If the engine is already speaking some text, then the current speech will
      be terminated (without calling OnSpeechFinished).

      This method is asynchronous. It returns immediately and speaks the text
      in the background. IsSpeaking will return False until the engine actually
      starts speaking.

      The OnSpeechStarted event is fired when the engine actually starts to
      speak. }

          fired).
        False when the engine has finished speaking (and OnSpeechFinished has
          been fired). }
